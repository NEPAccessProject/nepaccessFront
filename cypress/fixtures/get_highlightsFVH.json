Because the ability to drill from within the <b>mine</b> voids may be limited to about 400 feet, based on the MMC exploration plan, numerous piezometers would be required (Figure C-6). An array of small diameter boreholes would be installed from within the <b>mine</b>, and instrumented with continuous recording pressure transducers.

During final design, the agencies would provide MMC with data from the Troy <b>Mine</b>, which has experienced pillar stability problems resulting in surface subsidence. The data collected and analyzed from the Troy <b>Mine</b> will aid the agencies in their evaluation of MMC’s proposed design and monitoring plan. For example, data from the Troy <b>Mine</b> indicates that adverse pillar orientation with regard to bedding dip may have played a role in some of the pillar instability. Further, the Troy <b>Mine</b> sinkhole events appear to be related to encroaching too close to known faults. This information would be used to aid in the development of MMC’s underground <b>mine</b> design. The monitoring plan would be in a continual process of modification throughout"]]
