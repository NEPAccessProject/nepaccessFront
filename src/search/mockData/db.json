Samaniego Ridge and Reef of Rocks dramatically rise to the crest of the range, parallel ridges that harbor Santa Catalina’s longest drainage, Cañado del Oro, at nearly 25 miles in length. This <b>canyon</b> and <b>Sabino</b> <b>Canyon</b> are the only known drainages in this range to have historically contained native fishes. Alder <b>Canyon</b>, on the east slope of the Santa Catalina Mountains, is notable for its large deposits of limestone and dolomite, which are uncommon within the range at these concentrations.
